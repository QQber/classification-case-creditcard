# Classification Machine learninng for a Bank Credit Card offer
This project is a part of the [IRON HACK](http://https://www.ironhack.com/en) at Berlin Data Camo. Other Bootcamp projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://https://github.com/QQber).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is Build a model that will provide insight into why some bank customers accept credit card offers. There are also other potential areas of opportunities that the bank wants to understand from the data.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Tableau
* MySQL
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* sklearn
* matplot

## Project Description
The project provides data about details from the customer either they accepted the credit card offer or not. The purpose would be to make a machine learning model for the bank
to have a better understanding the market. During the project, I tried different method to deal the categorical and numerical data, spilted the data and learned them with Logistical Regression,
Decision Tree, Naive bayesian classification and KNN Classification. Decided to use Precision as the model ecaluate method. Also did data visulation in Tableau and data anaylzed with MySQL.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- presentation
